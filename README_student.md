i used the followings:
Class & Objects (OOP)

ArrayList from java.util

Scanner for user input

Menu-driven console program

 I built a simple system that stores multiple Student objects — just like storing entries in a database — but using ArrayList.

Each student has:

ID

Name

Marks

The program gives a menu where the user can:

Add a new student

View all students

Update a student by ID

Delete a student by ID
